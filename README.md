# Water Potability Project! ðŸ‘‹


## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the potability of water by analyzing various water quality attributes from a dataset. The key water quality parameters include:

- pH value
- Hardness
- Solids
- Chloramines
- Sulfate
- Conductivity
- Organic carbon
- Trihalomethanes
- Turbidity
The main goal is to determine if the water is potable (drinkable) or not based on these attributes.
## Data Preprocessing:
The dataset contains 3,276 records, each representing different water attributes. During preprocessing:

- Missing values were identified.
- Incomplete records were cleaned to ensure high-quality data for modeling.

## Model Selection and Performance
The Random Forest model was selected for predicting water potability. Its performance metrics are as follows:
- Accuracy: 0.6625
- Precision: 0.7100
- Recall: 0.3989
- F1-score: 0.5108
## Feature Importance
Key features identified by the model for predicting water potability include:

- pH value
- Solids
- Sulfate
These are critical parameters for assessing water quality.

## Visualization and Correlation
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helped identify correlations between various water quality parameters. Visualizations such as heatmaps and scatter plots were used to explore the relationships between different variables and their impact on water potability.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following steps are recommended to improve water quality predictions:

- Enhance Data Collection: Continuously update the data to ensure accurate water quality measurements and maintain model relevance.
- Data Quality Checks: Implement processes to minimize missing values.
- Advanced Data Collection Methods: Utilize advanced techniques to reduce human error in data collection.
Problem Statement
In the context of predictive analytics and machine learning, the goal is to predict whether water is potable (drinkable) based on various parameters. The business problem centers on ensuring water is safe for human consumption, represented by:

- 1: Drinkable water
- 0: Non-drinkable water
This problem is addressed by evaluating parameters like pH, hardness, solids, chloramines, sulfate, conductivity, organic carbon, trihalomethanes, and turbidity. Solving this issue is vital for public health, as it helps prevent waterborne illnesses by ensuring clean water is accessible for everyone.

## Business Impact
Companies and water authorities can use this model to:

- Improve decision-making regarding water treatment.
- Reduce the time and cost involved in water quality analysis.
- Ensure trust by providing safe, clean drinking water.
- Automate the complex task of monitoring water quality through machine learning.
Predictive analytics also enables businesses to respond swiftly to new water quality challenges by analyzing large datasets from various sources.

## Data Collection and Preparation
The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle and includes 10 columns, with 9 representing independent features (pH, hardness, solids, chloramines, sulfate, conductivity, organic carbon, trihalomethanes, turbidity) and 1 target column representing water potability. The dataset is well-suited for predicting whether water is drinkable based on these essential parameters.

Data processing was conducted using the Pandas library. After importing the dataset, the first five rows were inspected using the df.head() function to better understand the structure and content of the data.
